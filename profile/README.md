_Learn new skills by completing real projects right in GitHub._

- **Learning should be fun**: There are no simulations or boring tutorials here, just hands-on lessons created by GitHub and taught with GitHub Actions.
- **Real projects**: Learn new skills while working in your own copy of a real project.
- **Helpful bot**: GitHub Actions provides instructions and feedback throughout your journey.
- **Real workflow**: Everything happens with real GitHub features, such as Issues, Actions, and Codespaces.
