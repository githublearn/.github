# Advance your GitHub journey

_Learn new skills by completing realistic projects in your own GitHub repository, or build your own courses using these template repositories._

- :dancer: **Learning should be fun**: There are no simulations or boring tutorials here, just hands-on lessons created by GitHub and taught with GitHub Actions.
- :hammer_and_wrench: **Real projects**: Learn new skills while working in your own copy of a real project.
- :robot: **Helpful bot**: GitHub Actions provides instructions and feedback throughout your journey.
- :computer: **Real workflow**: Everything happens with real GitHub features, such as Issues, Actions, and Codespaces.

Get started building your own courses by with our [GitHub Skills Quickstart Guide](https://skills.github.io/.github/quickstart). ðŸŒŸ
